Dear Parents,

SCHOOL TIME

SCHOOL BUS

As a part of our study of marine life, we will be taking a field trip to the Aquarium. We will leave shortly after school starts, and we will take a bus together to the aquarium. Students will view a short film about coral reefs, and then we will divide into chaperoned groups of 4-7 to see the fish. Each group will have a worksheet to fill out as they observe and read about different species. Students should bring their lunch, and we will eat as a group before heading back to the school on the bus. If you would be interested in chaperoning, please write a note on the permission slip.

Please sign and return the bottom of this page. You can keep this top part for your

reference.
